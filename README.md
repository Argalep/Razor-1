 # Razor: An Ultima Online Assistant

Razor is a free tool designed to help with simple tasks while playing Ultima Online.

While it is recommended that you use [ClassicUO](https://github.com/andreakarasho/ClassicUO) with this version of Razor, it will work with the old 5.x and 7.x clients.

## UO:R Community Edition

The goal of this project is to revive and continue development and maintenance of the abandoned Razor project while focusing on "quality of life" improvements without driving down the path of automation and advanced scripting that is found in other UO assistants.

This project also attempts to keep the spirit and vision the original developers had for Razor.

## History

Razor was originally designed by Bryan Pass, known as Zippy in the RunUO community as a replacement to UOAssist. Based on commit notes, active development on Razor ceased some time in the early 2010's with the source code being released in 2014.

The code initially didn't include Crypt.dll and Loader.dll which are required to full integration with UO. At some point, the code was released into the same [GitHub repo](https://github.com/msturgill/razor).

This version of Razor is based off of 1.4.0.3, which is simply version 1.0.13.13 updated from .NET 2.0 to .NET 4.0. Another version of Razor exists (the 1.0.14.x versions) and is/was maintained by another private shard that make some enhancements, notable around targeting. This version of Razor has incorporated the majority of changes you can find in those versions.

The original project was last updated May 2nd, 2014 and while over 50 forks exist on GitHub, none have been active or have made significant changes except for a few exceptions.

  * [Jaedan](https://github.com/jaedan) (which this version is based on) who updated the project to compile and work in Visual Studio 2017 and made improvements to Crypt.dll that enabled this project to move forward.
  * [uoitalia](https://github.com/uoitalia) who made several performance changes from generic to non-generic collections that I incorporated in the first release.

## Versions

All version of Razor doesn't use the Windows Registry or %AppData%\Razor to store configuration, macros and profiles. In other words, it's portable.

* **1.5.0.0** to **1.5.0.16** only support the standard Ultima Online client.
* **1.5.0.17** has major changes to how Razor determines player position and only supports the standard Ultima Online client.
* **1.6.x.x** support both the standard client and [ClassicUO](https://github.com/andreakarasho/ClassicUO).

## Razor Scripting

This version of Razor also supports a command-based script language.  Visit the [Razor Scripting Guide](http://www.uor-razor.com/guide/) for more information.

## Install: New ClassicUO with Razor Install

These steps assume that you already have obtained and installed the Ultima Online game asset files in the local system and want to install ClassicUO and Razor for the first time.

* Create a new folder on your local computer (ie: C:\Games\ClassicUO)
* Open PowerShell prompt and go to folder you created
* Execute the following PowerShell commands

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString(
'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/markdwags/Razor/master/InstallClassicUOAndRazor-NoDefaults.ps1'))
```

* Follow the on-screen prompts to set up the ClassicUO settings.json file first the first time.

## Install: Existing ClassicUO and/or Standard Client

These steps assume that you already have obtained and installed the Ultima Online game asset files in the local system and are already using ClassicUO or the standard client.

### Standard Client & ClassicUO Client

* Download the latest release
* Extract into any location (ie: C:\UO\Razor)
* (Optional) If you have an existing version of Razor, copy the Profiles and Macros folders from %AppData%\Razor into the folder you extracted the zip above to. If you have custom counters, also copy counters.xml over.

### If using the standard client

* Right-Click on the Razor shortcut or Razor.exe, go to Properties. On the Compatibility tab, select Run this program in compatibility mode for and select Windows XP SP2.
* Run Razor either via the shortcut or clicking the Razor.exe directly.
* Razor should prompt to Run As Administrator. You must allow this for Razor to function correctly.  

### If using ClassicUO

* Go to the folder where you have ClassicUO installed and edit settings.json. 

```json
  "plugins": [
    ".\\Assistant\\Razor.dll"
  ]
```

* Find the section above and edit the path to point to where you extract Razor in the above step. For example, if I extracted it to **C:\UO\Razor** my settings.json would look like this:

```json
  "plugins": [
    "C:\\UO\\Razor\\Razor.exe"
  ]
```

* When you launch ClassicUO, Razor will load up during the startup process.
